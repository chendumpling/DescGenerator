# texttohtml
Text To HTML GUI made for a client who runs a shopify store. The description of the product page is written in HTML. This GUI is made to make it easier for the client to write the HTML description with zero knowledge. This is made specifically for the client, so details have been hidden out of the code in this repo, and functionality will not work for your own projects unless you change a part of the code within index.js and index.html.
